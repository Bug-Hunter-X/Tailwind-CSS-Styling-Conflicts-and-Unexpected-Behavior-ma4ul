This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework that uses a different CSS methodology or when there are conflicts between Tailwind's styles and other CSS rules.

**Example:**

```html
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4">
  <p class="text-xl font-bold">This text has unexpected styling</p>
</div>
```

If the `text-xl` class doesn't apply expected styling, or if `bg-gray-200` produces unexpected colors, it might be a CSS conflict.
